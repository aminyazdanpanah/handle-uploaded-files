The powerful upload manger for PHP that allows you to save all your uploaded files with a validator and extract details of files into an `array`. 

## Features
* Easily manage your all uploaded files by using config_file variable.
* Validate your uploaded files by adding `validator` key in your config_file array.
* Extract the details of uploaded files into an array.
* PHP > 7.1.0.

## Installation

This version of the package is only compatible with PHP 7.1.0 or newer.

Install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require aminyazdanpanah/save-uploaded-files
```

## Basic Usage

``` php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$config_files = [
    [
        'name' => 'upload_image',
        'save_to' => __DIR__ . "/images/user/" . time(),
        'save_as' => generateRandomString(),
        'validator' => [
            'min_size' => 100,
            'max_size' => 2048,
            'types' => ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png']
        ]
    ]
];

$uploads = save_uploads($config_files)->all();
```
**Please see [example.php](https://github.com/aminyazdanpanah/save-uploaded-files/blob/master/examples/example.php) for more information. In that page you can see complete examples of usage of this package.**

## Documentation
First create your own html or ajax or other service that can pass files to server
##### example(html):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    Select files to upload: <br><br><br>
    Select an image: <input type="file" name="upload_image" id="upload_image"><br><br>
    Select a video: <input type="file" name="upload_video" id="upload_video"><br><br>
    Select a document(word): <input type="file" name="upload_doc" id="upload_doc"><br><br>
    Select a raw file: <input type="file" name="upload_raw" id="upload_raw"><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Upload" name="submit"><br><br>
</form>

</body>
</html>
``` 

In the sever side you should create a config file and pass it to `save_uploads()` method:
```php
$config_files = [
    [
        'name' => 'upload_image',
        'save_to' => __DIR__ . "/images/user/" . time(),
        'validator' => [
            'min_size' => 100,
            'max_size' => 2048,
            'types' => ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png']
        ]
    ],
    [
        'name' => 'upload_doc',
        'save_to' => __DIR__ . "/docs",
        'save_as' => 'my_doc_name',
        'override' => true,
        'validator' => [
            'min_size' => 10,
            'max_size' => 1024,
            'types' => ['doc', 'docx']
        ]
    ],
    [
        'name' => 'upload_video',
        'save_to' => __DIR__ . "/videos",
        'save_as' => generateRandomString(),
        'validator' => [
            'min_size' => 512, //512KB
            'max_size' => 1024 * 70, //70MB
            'types' => video_types()
        ]
    ],
    [
        'name' => 'upload_raw',
        'save_to' => __DIR__ . "/raw"
    ]
];

$uploads = save_uploads($config_files);
```

You can extract details of your upload:
```php
print_r($uploads->all());// Returns all uploads and their details.
print_r($uploads->get(['upload_video', 'upload_raw']));// Returns specified uploads and their details.
print_r($uploads->except(['upload_raw', 'upload_image']));// Returns all uploads and their details except those ones specified.
print_r($uploads->first());// Returns first upload and it's detail.
print_r($uploads->succeeded());// Returns all succeeded uploads and their details.
print_r($uploads->failed());// Returns all failed uploads and their details.
print_r($uploads->names());// Returns all upload names.
print_r($uploads->count());// Returns the number of uploads
```

An example of "details of the upload":

```text
[upload_doc] => Array
    (
        [status] => 1
        [message] => The file "CV -  Work  - Amin Yazdanpanah.docx" has been uploaded.
